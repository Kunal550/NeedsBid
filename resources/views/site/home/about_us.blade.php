                            <p>NeedBids LLC is a renowned marketing agency dedicated to helping local construction contractors grow and
                                scale their businesses. We provide critical marketing assistance to help contractors achieve success.</p>

                            <p>As the construction industry continues to grow, so does the need for qualified contractors. When it comes
                                to the growing construction business, finding qualified contractors is key. By using the NeedBids bidding
                                platform, local contractors can save both time and money that would normally be spent manually going out
                                looking for new jobs and putting together bids.</p>

                            <p>NeedBids LLC has been providing its service to local construction contractors for more than a decade now.
                                The bidding platform allows contractors to bid on jobs manually or through a system that syncs with their
                                email inboxes. Contractors can also create proposals and manage their projects from one location.</p>

                            <p>we provide small local contractors with the opportunity to easily find and submit bids for new projects.
                                Our cutting-edge web platform enables contractors to search for potential jobs quickly and efficiently,
                                while simultaneously keeping them visible to potential customers.</p>

                            <p>Additionally, smaller contractors now have an equal footing when bidding against larger, more established
                                companies, thanks to the internet. Let NeedBids give your construction business a competitive edge!</p>

                                in the competitive construction market. Contractors may now browse a variety of projects on our website
                                and bid on them. This can also encourage them to step outside their comfort zone and work on projects from
                                other sectors rather than simply one. We provide the necessary tools and resources that equip small
                                contractors with the means to grow and scale their businesses - starting with our platform NeedBids.Com!

                                Jeffrey Rodriguez, CEO of NeedBids LLC, has over 25 years of experience in construction management and
                                hands-on field experience as a carpenter and contractor. While his experience with large construction
                                projects makes him an expert at orchestrating complex schedules, Jeffrey is intimately familiar with the
                                needs of smaller businesses. He has successfully managed projects across a diverse range of industries
                                while exhibiting excellent business acumen and the ability to motivate and lead teams. Having been
                                involved in the construction industry for over two decades, Jeffrey understands each and every barrier
                                that contractors face. This includes the early stages as well as when they are at the peak of their
                                careers. His goal with NeedBids is to assist contractors in embarking on projects that will be highly
                                beneficial to them in the long run. </p>
